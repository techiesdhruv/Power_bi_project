## 📈 Project Insights
- 🔸 13.8% overall attrition rate from a workforce of 918 employees

- 🔸 Women (11%) attrite slightly less than men (15%)

- 🔸 Maximum attrition from employees aged 18-25 (31%)

- 🔸 Top job roles facing attrition: Lab Technicians (24%) and Research Scientists (16%)

- 🔸 Employees with Technical Degrees (37%) have the highest attrition among education fields

- 🔸 Employees with less than 1 year of experience (36%) are more likely to leave

- 🔸 Majority of low earners (under 5K salary) contribute to higher attrition

## Final Conclusion
To reduce attrition and retain top talent, the organization should focus on onboarding, engagement, and development strategies for young, early-career professionals with technical degrees, especially in lab and research roles. Special attention should be given to employees in the 18-25 age group and those with low experience, as they show the highest turnover rates. Improving compensation structures and employee growth opportunities in these categories can significantly reduce attrition and improve overall workforce stability.
